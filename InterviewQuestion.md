two phase : 1.Memory creation -variable declared with undefined and function with definition
and 2.Code execution- assign value to variable and calling function to create new EC and remove after getting result of function.
Global EC is pushed into Callstack(Callstack is stack which is used to maintain order of execution of EC)
2)Hoisting

3)Temporal dead zone
:- In EC, after memory creation

5)Different types of errors and how to produce them.Implementation-based questions based on let, var, const
